# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a lab website project. The codebase structure and development commands will be updated as the project is initialized and developed.

## Development Commands

Commands will be added here once the project structure is established. Common patterns to look for:

- Check for package.json, requirements.txt, or similar dependency files to determine the tech stack
- Look for scripts in package.json or Makefile for build/test/lint commands
- Check for framework-specific configuration files (next.config.js, vite.config.js, etc.)

## Architecture

Project architecture details will be documented here as the codebase develops.
